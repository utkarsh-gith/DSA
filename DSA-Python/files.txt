Open:
 - use open command
 - For eg: file1 = open("/Users/utkarshpratapsingh/Programming/Python/Codes/example.txt","mode")
            Here mode can be r,w,A

After openeing the file:
 - file1.name will give the name of the file
 - file1.mode will give the mode of the file
 - file1.close() to close the file

Opening using with:
 - with open("filepath","mode") as file1:
     file_stuff = file1.read()
     print(file_stuff)
   print(file1.closed) //to check if file is closed
   print(file_stuff)
 
 - with open("filepath","mode") as file1:
     file1stuff1 = file1.readline() // line 1
     file1stuff2 = file1.readline() // line 2

 - with open("filepath","mode") as file1:
     for line in file1:
      print(line)
 
 - with open("filepath","mode") as file1:
     file1stuff1 = file1.readline(5) // first 5 characters
     file1stuff2 = file1.readline(10) // next 10 characters

 In write mode, if the file is existing, it will be deleted and new one will be created
 If no file exists, then new file will be created

 - file1 = open("/Users/utkarshpratapsingh/Programming/Python/Codes/example.txt","w")
   file1.write("Hello World!\nI am Utkarsh\nHave a good day")
   file1.close()

 - Line = "This is line 1\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3"
   with open("/Users/utkarshpratapsingh/Programming/Python/Codes/example.txt","w") as file1:
    for line in Line:
        file1.write(line)

 In append mode:
   if file exists, it appends the characters to the existing file
   if file does not exist it creates a new file

Copying contents of one file to another:

 with open("/Users/utkarshpratapsingh/Programming/Python/Codes/example.txt","r") as readfile:
    with open("/Users/utkarshpratapsingh/Programming/Python/Codes/example1.txt","w") as writefile:
        for line in readfile:
            writefile.write(line)
