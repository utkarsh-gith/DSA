Dictionaries:
 - denoted by curly brackets {} 
 - keys have to be immutable and unique
 - values can be immutable,mutable or duplicates
 - each key and value pair is separated by a comma
 - For Eg: { "key1":1 , "key2":"2" , "key3":[3,3,3] , "key4":(4,4,4) , ('key5'):5 }

 - Let Dict = { "Iron Man":2008 , "The Incredible Hulk":2008 , "Thor":2011 , "Captain America: The First Avenger":2011 , "Marvelâ€™s The First Avengers":2012 }

   Dict["Iron Man"] will give 2008
   Dict["Thor"] will give 2011

   we can new values to the Dictionary -> Dict["Ant-Man"] = 2015 

   we can delete values from Dictionary using del command -> del(Dict["Thor"])

   To check any key is present in Dictionary using in command -> "Thor" in Dict will give True
                                                                 "Spider-Man" in Dict will give False
    
    To get all the keys in dictionary use keys() command -> Dict.keys()
    To get all the values in dictionary use values() command -> Dict.values()
